A group project made for the purpose of a university course. I took on the role of the leader of the 3 person group.

The interactive mode works as an in-person board game where each player takes turns.  
The autonomous mode was made for the purpose of gameplay between two programs.  

Game instructions  
1. This is a simplified version of a board game “Hey, that’s mine fish".  
2. Game is played in turns - in each turn each player moves one penguin. The aim is to collect the
   most fish.  
3. The game board is arranged in a square grid with m rows and n columns. Each field of the grid
   can be empty or can have an ice floe with 1, 2 or 3 fish on it.  
4. Each game is played on a new, possibly randomly generated, board. Each player has a certain
   (known) number of penguins.  
5. There are two phases of the game:  
   a) Placing the penguins on the board;  
   b) Playing the game.  
6. Placing the penguins:  
   a) In a single turn the player places one of his penguins on an unoccupied ice floe with exactly
   one fish on it.  
   b) When placing the penguin, the fish on the target ice floe is collected by the player and
   removed from the ice floe. This way the ice flow with a penguin does not have any fish.  
   c) The move is compulsory.  
   d) The placing phase ends when all the penguins are placed on the game board.  
7. Playing the game:  
   a) In his turn, the player chooses one of his penguins and moves it in a straight line (only along
   the grid lines) to another unoccupied ice floe. The previous ice floe is removed from the
   board. The move over the field without ice floe or over other penguin is forbidden. When
   placing the penguin, the fish on the target ice floe is collected by the player and removed
   from the ice floe, immediately.  
   b) If possible, the move is compulsory.  
   c) Game ends when no penguin can make a move.  
8. The player who collects the most fish wins.
